# Synapse admin ui

This project is built using [react-admin](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/).

## Fork differences

With [Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin](https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin) as the upstream, this
fork is intended to be a more feature-rich version of the original project. The main goal is to provide a more
user-friendly interface for managing Synapse homeservers.

The following changes are already implemented:

* [Prevent admins from deleting themselves](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/1)

_the list will be updated as new changes are added_

## Usage

### Supported Synapse

It needs at least [Synapse](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse) v1.93.0 for all functions to work as expected!

You get your server version with the request `/_synapse/admin/v1/server_version`.
See also [Synapse version API](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/version_api.html).

After entering the URL on the login page of synapse-admin the server version appears below the input field.

### Prerequisites

You need access to the following endpoints:

- `/_matrix`
- `/_synapse/admin`

See also [Synapse administration endpoints](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/reverse_proxy.html#synapse-administration-endpoints)

### Use without install

You can use the current version of Synapse Admin without own installation direct
via [GitHub Pages](https://awesome-technologies.github.io/synapse-admin/).

**Note:**
If you want to use the deployment, you have to make sure that the admin endpoints (`/_synapse/admin`) are accessible for your browser.
**Remember: You have no need to expose these endpoints to the internet but to your network.**
If you want your own deployment, follow the [Step-By-Step Install Guide](#step-by-step-install) below.

### Step-By-Step install

You have three options:

1.  [Download the tarball and serve with any webserver](#steps-for-1)
2.  [Download the source code from github and run using nodejs](#steps-for-2)
3.  [Run the Docker container](#steps-for-3)

#### Steps for 1)

- make sure you have a webserver installed that can serve static files (any webserver like nginx or apache will do)
- configure a vhost for synapse admin on your webserver
- download the .tar.gz from the latest release: https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin/releases/latest
- unpack the .tar.gz
- move or symlink the `synapse-admin-x.x.x` into your vhosts root dir
- open the url of the vhost in your browser

#### Steps for 2)

- make sure you have installed the following: git, yarn, nodejs
- download the source code: `git clone https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin.git`
- change into downloaded directory: `cd synapse-admin`
- download dependencies: `yarn install`
- start web server: `yarn start`

#### Steps for 3)

- run the Docker container from the public docker registry: `docker run -p 8080:80 awesometechnologies/synapse-admin` or use the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml): `docker-compose up -d`

  > note: if you're building on an architecture other than amd64 (for example a raspberry pi), make sure to define a maximum ram for node. otherwise the build will fail.

  ```yml
  services:
    synapse-admin:
      container_name: synapse-admin
      hostname: synapse-admin
      build:
        context: https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin.git
        args:
          - BUILDKIT_CONTEXT_KEEP_GIT_DIR=1
        #   - NODE_OPTIONS="--max_old_space_size=1024"
        #   - BASE_PATH="/synapse-admin"
      ports:
        - "8080:80"
      restart: unless-stopped
  ```

- browse to http://localhost:8080

### Restricting available homeserver

You can restrict the homeserver(s), so that the user can no longer define it himself.

Edit `config.json` to restrict either to a single homeserver:

```json
{
  "restrictBaseUrl": "https://your-matrixs-erver.example.com"
}
```

or to a list of homeservers:

```json
{
  "restrictBaseUrl": ["https://your-first-matrix-server.example.com", "https://your-second-matrix-server.example.com"]
}
```

The `config.json` can be injected into a Docker container using a bind mount.

```yml
services:
  synapse-admin:
    ...
    volumes:
      ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
    ...
```

### Serving Synapse-Admin on a different path

The path prefix where synapse-admin is served can only be changed during the build step.

If you downloaded the source code, use `yarn build --base=/my-prefix` to set a path prefix.

If you want to build your own Docker container, use the `BASE_PATH` argument.

We do not support directly changing the path where Synapse-Admin is served in the pre-built Docker container. Instead please use a reverse proxy if you need to move Synapse-Admin to a different base path. If you want to serve multiple applications with different paths on the same domain, you need a reverse proxy anyway.

Example for Traefik:

`docker-compose.yml`

```yml
services:
  traefik:
    image: traefik:mimolette
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro

  synapse-admin:
    image: awesometechnologies/synapse-admin:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.synapse-admin.rule=Host(`example.com`)&&PathPrefix(`/admin`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.synapse-admin.middlewares=admin,admin_path"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.admin.redirectregex.regex=^(.*)/admin/?"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.admin.redirectregex.replacement=$${1}/admin/"
      - "traefik.http.middlewares.admin_path.stripprefix.prefixes=/admin"
```
